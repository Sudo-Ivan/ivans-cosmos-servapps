  "longDescription": "<p>It's a file-based wiki that aims to simplicity. The documents are completely written in Markdown which is an easy markup language that you can learn in 60 sec.</p><p>Instead of storing the data in a database I chose to have a file-based system. The advantage of this system is that every file is directly readable inside a terminal etc. Also when you have direct access to the system you can export the files to anything you like.</p><p>To view the documents in the browser, the document is converted to html.</p>",
